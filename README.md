## Introduction

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the fundamental building blocks of web development. HTML is used to structure the content on a web page, while CSS is used to style and format that content. This guide will teach you the basics of both languages so you can create your own web pages.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++)
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)
- An internet connection to access online resources

No prior programming experience is required. This guide is beginner-friendly.
